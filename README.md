My artwork performs style transfer on a set of images using TensorFlow Hub. The program first loads the pre-trained model 'arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2' from TensorFlow Hub. It reads and preprocesses the images to be styled and the target style image. 

The human figure serves as the main subject of this set of content images, which overall conveys a somber atmosphere. For the style image, I used my own flower artwork. The program then applies the style transfer model to the content images using the style image and generates a set of stylized images. Through processing, I created a set of images that evoke a sense of suppressed beauty.
Finally, I overlay some text on the generated images using random fonts, sizes, and positions. Using text to add an artistic atmosphere.
